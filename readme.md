# WORFOMETER

It's an odometer for a hedgehog named Worf.

## Setup

Requires Python >= 3.7 & nginx. Clone the repo to `/opt/worfometer`. In each of the service directories, create a virtualenv at `.venv/` and install requirements.txt. After that, you should be able to just run `sudo ./install.sh` and get to the web frontend on port 80.
